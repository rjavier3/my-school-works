Using the provided HMTL/CSS starting files, take this confusing web menu and give it some meaning with the principle of proximity. Visually show the relationships and patterns within the content using appropriate white space. Test your design with the squint test, are the groupings of content clear when squinting from a distance? Read through the HTML file to understand all the relationships between the content. <b>Note:</b> there are two 'special' items on the menu that you will want to feature and have stand out.

You may edit the HTML as needed to make changes to the styles or layout, but keep the content the same. No removing or adding content allowed.

The above is for the first four starts. The last star out of five will be given for adding contrast, repetition, and alignment. Use the online text area to explain exactly how you brought in the other three principles.

When finished rename the project folder to proximity-username, zip up the folder (.zip) and upload it to Moodle for submission. Be sure to include your list (a bullet point is fine) of explanations for all four principles in the online text area. Late submissions will not be accepted for marking.
